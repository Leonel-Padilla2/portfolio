        <p>
          I'm a Front-End developer, I have learned programming basics at the university, since then I've been learning and developing projects.
          Sort of 1 year ago I started learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React and I decided I wanted to learn as much as I could about it,
          so I have been developing pojects by myself, also, I had the oportunity to participate on international events where I 
          worked on teams with people all arround the world.

          I'm a Front-End developer, I am currently working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, 
          I am currently studying infotecnology engeneering at the Universidad Jose Cecilio del Valle.
